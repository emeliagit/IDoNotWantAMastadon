# IDoNotWantAMastadon

I found a pretty cool thing on Twitter, where someone made a neat game with a funny concept. I decided to program it in C++, as I thought it would be a fun challenge. All credit goes to @deathbybadger on Twitter for coming up with the idea, writing it down, putting it in a neat graphic, and posting it to Twitter. I am not affiliated with @deathbybadger, and I do not plan on selling this as a product. I simply thought it would be fun to program it, and I was correct, it was quite fun. it's not perfect, but I'll improve upon it as my skills improve.

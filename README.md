# IDoNotWantAMastadon

I found a pretty cool thing on Twitter, where someone made a neat game with a funny concept. I decided to program it in C++, as I thought it would be a fun challenge. All credit goes to @deathbybadger on Twitter for coming up with the idea, writing it down, putting it in a neat graphic, and posting it to Twitter. I am not affiliated with @deathbybadger, and I do not plan on selling this as a product. I simply thought it would be fun to program it, and I was correct, it was quite fun. it's not perfect, but I'll improve upon it as my skills improve. 

For now, I'm not quite certain as to how to make the main functions repeat until you reach 10 on each stat, as every time I try to put it in a separate function, I get an overwhelming number of errors that I'm too anxious to debug. I could technically repeat it like 30 times, but that would be incredibly innefficient, which is less than ideal. Please, do feel free to help out and contribute code, I'd love to learn some ways to do this better. Anyway, for the time being, it's completely functional, but you'll have to keep track of your scores (which it tells you in the end of each round how many you've accumulated for that round) separately, but other than that, it works pretty much perfectly (but do expect a bug or two, I get like 15 errors when compiling, though they don't seem to be a big issue, as it still compiles anyway.

INSTALLATION:
To install this, all you need to do is compile the main.cpp file with whatever C++ compiler you like, then run the output. Personally, I enjoy using Clang, but you can use whatever you like. I will also upload compiled binaries for Unix-like systems in the releases page, which you can run by opening a terminal in the directory that contains the binary file (.out is the file extension) and running "./IDoNotWantAMastadon.out".
